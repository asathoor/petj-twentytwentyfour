# petj-twentytwentyfour
 
 A styled version of the Twenty Twenty Four WP theme for 2024. Read my tutorial about the tweaks on [here: How to Modify a WordPress Style](https://multimusen.dk/2023/12/how-to-modify-a-wordpress-style/).

 The major changes are:

 * Header: foreground / background color switch
 * Footer: layout changes
 * Links: color contrast

IMHO the color contrast between links and the color selection is too limited. So I've added link and :hover colors.

## Concerning Custom Fonts

In the fonts section I have added the Permanent Marker font from Google Fonts. The files are found in ./assets/fonts/Permanent_Marker/

From Google I had to download a .ttf file, however it had to be converted to .woff2 - and here I used this free online converter tool:
